### All games made in Python - Pygame, Tkinter and Turtle


### 1. Connect 4
* For making this game I have used the pygame module. Connect4 is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 
* The pieces are to be manoeuvred over the top of the board using your mouse and simply 'left-click' to drop the piece in the particular block.

### 2. Pong
* Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The Game has been designed using the turtle module.
  * Controls -
  1. The paddle for player A can be moved using w(up), s(down), a(left) and d(right).
  2. The paddel for player B can be moved using up, down, right and left arrow keys.

### 3. Snake 2D
* Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. This game too has been made using the turtle module.
  * Controls -The snake is to be maneuvered using the arrow keys up, down, left and right.

### 4. To Do App
* The goal was to create a simple "To do list" to keep track of the jobs you need to finish. The program has been designed using the Tkinter module (Standard GUI Library for Python).
* This To-do-List program can perform jobs such as Adding Tasks, Deleting tasks, Sorting the tasks (Either in Ascending or Descending order), Displaying a Random Task, and Displaying the total no. of tasks currently stored in the To-do-List.

### 5. Space Invaders 
* The Space_Invaders is a classic arcade game. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.
* Each time the bullet hits the enemy, the enemy is destroyed and the player gets a point.
* I have added sounds for bullet fire and the bullet hitting the enemy.
  * Controls -The player can maneuver the battleship using arrow key 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right' and can fire bullets using spacebar.

### 6. Dodge
* The Dodger game has the player control a small person (which we call the playerâ€™s character) who must dodge a whole bunch of baddies that fall from the top of the screen. The longer the player can keep dodging the baddies, the higher the score they will get.
  * Controls -The player can maneuver using the arrow keys 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right'.

### 7. Client-Server Chat application
* Created a chat server which takes in the name of the host and once the connection is set we can chat between the client and the server. The two files need to be run simultaneously.
